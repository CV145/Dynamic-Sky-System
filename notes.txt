updateMatrixWorld() - updates the world matrix of an object. This matrix determines the object's position, rotation, and scale in world space.

In 3D graphics, every object has:
- A local matrix: Defines the object's position, rotation, and scale relative to its parent.
- A world matrix: Defines the object's position, rotation, and scale relative to the global (world) coordinate system.

Call updateMatrixWorld after calling set() to ensure the matrix reflects the latest changes

Casting shadows:
- For objects to cast and receive shadows, both the renderer, the light source, and the objects themselves need to be configured to handle shadows

The sunLight.shadow.camera in three.js is a virtual camera that determines the area in the scene where shadows are cast when using a DirectionalLight or a SpotLight. It defines the boundaries of the shadow casting area, which is important because shadows are calculated based on what is visible within this shadow camera's frustum (viewing area).

You can think of the shadow camera like a "light frustum" that captures the parts of the scene that will cast shadows. Any objects outside this frustum will not cast shadows.
